# moon demo
This is a Study project.
Using [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sLqXFF8mlEU&t=115s) as a reference, I reproduced the same thing in three.js.
This is a demo to reproduce the shape of the moon.

## feature
- Retrieve and render each terrain from GeoTiff.
- The system can also work with data from terrain other than the Moon (e.g., Earth or Mars).

This is only a base. I will build on this to create an emoi project!
